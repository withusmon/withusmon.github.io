I believe professional growth is crucial for developers aiming to succeed in their careers. Having worked in different companies and teams, I've made many decisions about this topic for myself. Let me share my thoughts with you in this article.

As a developer, your growth is in your hands. I see companies in two categories. The first helps you grow, offering challenging projects and learning opportunities. The second, is not so much, due to factors like uninteresting projects or team dynamics. But, in both situations, your growth depends on you.

If your current company falls into the first category I mentioned earlier, consider yourself lucky. You'll likely work on challenging projects with an organized and enthusiastic team. I also recommend dedicating at least 1 hour after work to learn new technologies or anything beneficial for your growth.

Sometimes you might work at a company that is completely different than what you expected. In this case, it's difficult to be consistent for a lot of developers. However, you might still grow if you keep your studies consistent. For example, there are no enthusiastic members, you are working on boring or smaller projects, and so on. To increase your skills in this kind of situation, all you have to do is sacrifice your extra time, at least an hour. Pick whatever you are going to learn and divide it into milestones. I highly recommend it at first as it helps you to stay consistent. Also, direct your focus toward specific topics. For instance, you might want to learn Network Engineering and direct your focus for that. If you cannot focus on something for a long time, this learning process won't last long. In my experience, I spent several hours daily learning, but the mistake I made was learning different topics simultaneously. It leads you to burnout. Therefore never try to do that. Also, try to apply what you learn to real-world projects. Since hands-on knowledge is what matters!

To sum up, avoid lengthy roadmaps to stay consistent and motivated. Set achievable milestones to prevent burnout. Don't rely only on projects or companies for your professional growth.
